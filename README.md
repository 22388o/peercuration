# Peercuration

## TL;DR
Peercuration makes it possible to mitigate proliferation of spam in decentralized social media networks. It is a simple mechanism that works like this. A node in a network, query its trusted nodes for their individual score of a hash, and then calculate the average score. The hash is a mathematically derived identifier for a digitally encoded resource. The score is a value between 0 and 1. This mechanism provides the means of creating a sorted list of digital resources (such as images, videos, social media comments, etc.), which makes it possible to weed out bad content from good and thus produce a curated list.

## The problem
In the early 2020 it was impossible to ignore how many people had become aware of the power of "the algorithm". Elon Musk boosted the outcry against "the Twitter algorithm" on Twitter and argued that it should be open sourced. Other people made it clear the open sourcing was not enough, and social networks needed to be decentralized, so as to put an end to centrally controlled content distribution. People argued that Facebook streams, YouTube video lists, where designed to merely captivate people by creating "hits of dopamine" and did not have the best of the users as heart. True or not, in an attention economy, social networks live and die by how much users are using them.

## Spam
While decentralization of social media solves issues related to centrally controlled content distribution, it opens the doors to other issues such as spam. In an open network, there is nothing preventing bots from creating a never ending stream of spam. While heavily modereated social media platforms such as Reddit, may be critized for censoring comments, at least spam and content that do not belong in the stream, is weeded out by moderators. When the network is open for anyone to post anything, this kind of fix to the problem is incompatable if staying true to the ethos of decentralization. 

## The Solution: Peercuration
We propose a solution to this problem and it is called Peercuration. Inspired by concepts such as "Wisdom of crowds" and "Web of trust", the general idea behind Peercuration, is that you as a user knows the best which other users you want to trust and follow. Afterall, who could know better what your prefernces are then yourself and who would you want to be the one to decide which those are!

When everyone in a network establish connections with those they trust the most, then together they create a web of trust. This trust can be leveraged to weed out spam and moderate content. The only thing needed is for everyone to create a score content they consume and this information is then used to create an average score. Content with the best score can be prioritized for download and display in user interfaces, and content with the lowest score might even be blocked from propagation.
